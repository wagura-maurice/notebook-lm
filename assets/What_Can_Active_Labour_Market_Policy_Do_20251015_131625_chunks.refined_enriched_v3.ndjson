Broadly speaking, this policy framework might be represented as an endorsement of \"active labour market policies\", that is programmes to encourage job search and assist labour mobility, as against reliance on \"passive\" policies (payment of unemployment benefit) as a response to the problems of structural change. From a structural perspective, the argument for active labour market policies seems a plausible one. If unemployment is caused by labour immobility in the face of changing demand, then encouraging labour mobility would appear to be an appropriate policy response.",

Theories of unemployment hysteresis (the idea that the equilibrium unemployment rate would adjust to the actual unemployment rate, so that a temporary shock to unemployment would persist indefinitely) had been couched in terms of insiderloutsider models (Blanchard and Summers, 1986; Lindbeck and Snower, 1988) and in terms of the effects of long-term unemployment (Layard and Nickell, 1987; Blanchard and Diamond, 1994). \n\nBut both theoretical argument and empirical evidence (reviewed, e.g. by Layard *et* al., 1991) appear to establish that though these factors were important, the degree of hysteresis was significantly less than 100 percent. The return of unemployment to its long-run equilibrium might be prolonged but would not be prevented by these types of factors.\n\nThe idea that worsening structural imbalance in the labour market could be the explanation of persistent high unemployment had of course been frequently proposed.

By the end of the 1980s, the belief that continuing high unemployment could be explained primarily in terms of a never ending hangover from the deflationary policies of the beginning of the decade was becoming increasingly hard to sustain. Theories of unemployment hysteresis (the idea that the equilibrium unemployment rate would adjust to the actual unemployment rate, so that a temporary shock to unemployment would persist indefinitely) had been couched in terms of insiderloutsider models (Blanchard and Summers, 1986; Lindbeck and Snower, 1988) and in terms of the effects of long-term unemployment (Layard and Nickell, 1987; Blanchard and Diamond, 1994). But both theoretical argument and empirical evidence (reviewed, e.g. by Layard *et* al., 1991) appear to establish that though these factors were important, the degree of hysteresis was significantly less than 100 percent. The return of unemployment to its long-run equilibrium might be prolonged but would not be prevented by these types of factors. The idea that worsening structural imbalance in the labour market could be the explanation of persistent high unemployment had of course been frequently proposed. But evidence on sectoral unemployment rates (surveyed, e.g.",
