Background | Enacted in 1982, JTPA is the largest federal employment training program,<br>with titles II-A and II-C intended to prepare economically disadvantaged<br>adults and youths, respectively, for entry into the labor force.7 JTPA<br>emphasizes state and local government responsibility for administering<br>federally funded job training programs. In fiscal year 1995, JTPA title II-A<br>and II-C programs received approximately \\$1.6 billion in funding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|            | JTPA training programs annually provide employment training for specific<br>occupations and services, such as job search assistance and remedial<br>education, to roughly one million economically disadvantaged individuals.<br>Training is provided in local service delivery areas (SDA) through service<br>providers, such as vocational-technical high schools, community colleges,<br>proprietary schools, and community-based organizations. The program<br>objectives are to increase earnings and employment and to reduce welfare<br>dependence for participants of all ages. During the NJS, participation in<br>JTPA involved roughly 3 to 4 months of training at an average cost of about<br>\\$2,400 per participant. |\n|            | In 1986, Labor commissioned the NJS to evaluate the impact of JTPA on<br>adults and youths because previous findings on the effects of job training<br>programs had been hampered by poor data and statistical problems. The<br>NJS randomly assigned persons who sought JTPA services, and were eligible<br>for them, to a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group<br>was offered JTPA training, and the control group was not. The study was<br>intended to ensure that the two groups would not differ systematically in<br>any way except access to the program, so any subsequent differences in<br>outcomes could be attributed solely to JTPA.
