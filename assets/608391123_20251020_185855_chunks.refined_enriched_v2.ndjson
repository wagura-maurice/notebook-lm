Several active labour market programmes support the integration of these needy job-seekers into the labour market. Our paper estimates the average effect of targeted wage subsidies – paid to employers for a limited period of time - on the subsequent labour market prospects of participating needy job-seekers. We apply propensity score matching to compare participants with a group of similar non-participants. The results show that wage subsidies had in fact large and significant favourable effects: 20 months after taking up a subsidised job, the share of persons in regular employment is nearly 40 percentage points higher across participants.

Similarly, Hamersma (2005) obtained insignificant effects of a subsidy on job tenure for the State of Wisconsin, using statistical matching techniques.\n\n<span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>Summing up, most studies find that taking up a subsidised job has positive effects on subsequent employment prospects of previous unemployed participants. \n\nHowever, some effects cannot be identified by the research designs underlying the studies mentioned above (Calmfors 1994). \n\nFirst, a deadweight loss occurs, if several of those subsidised would have been recruited also without help of a subsidy. The underlying reason might be imperfect information on the side of the caseworker as well as collusion between the public employment office and the employer. Studies relying on a statistical matching approach might interpret the share of comparison group members that found a job without the help of a subsidy as an indicator for the size of deadweight losses. Second, substitution effects prevail, if some of those taking up a subsidised job will merely replace other workers.

Furthermore, the results do not differ much from those obtained for participants from the entire group of unemployed persons during the pre-reform period. The positive findings are in line with international results on the effectiveness of wage subsidies. A Rosenbaum-bounds analysis suggests that our results are quite robust against hidden bias. In consequence, one might conclude that wage subsidies are an effective means to improve the economic self-sufficiency of previously unemployed workers. <span id=\"page-22-0\"></span>However, some caveats are in order: First, effectiveness of a programme on the individual level does not imply that the programme is also cost-efficient - the data contain, however, no individual information on the amount of the subsidy. Second, deadweight losses might be a serious problem - considerable shares of participating persons might have got the job also without subsidisation. Thus the allocation of subsidies has to be monitored carefully by the Public Employment Service and its caseworkers. Also incentive structures in the governance of the Public Employment Service have to be shaped in a way that collusion between caseworkers and firms can be ruled out.", "summary": "Wage subsidies improve unemployed workers' self-sufficiency but face challenges like deadweight losses and cost-efficiency concerns, requiring careful monitoring by the Public Employment Service."}, "_run_id": "a715ecc4-89df-4ca5-9b45-28e9340bac07", "_ts": "2025-10-20T17:01:16.915088+00:00"}
