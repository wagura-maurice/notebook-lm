In order to answer this question, it is vital to know *what works* among active policies and *in what circumstances*. The OECD Secretariat has been working intensively on these questions in recent years and the paper summarises the main results of our work to date.\n\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides some factual background on public spending on labour market policies in OECD countries over the past decade, drawing on an internationally comparable data set which the OECD has developed to monitor trends in this field of public spending. Then I summarise the main results of on-going OECD research into the effectiveness of active labour market policies. My review mainly exploits two sources: (i) the recent literature on the evaluation of labour market programs (Section 3); and (ii) in-depth reviews which the OECD has conducted over the past five years on the interactions between active and passive labour market policies in 16 OECD countries (Section 4).

Public spending on labour market programs absorbs significant shares of national resources in many OECD countries, these policies being expected to achieve a variety of economic and social objectives. For analytical and policy purposes, the OECD splits this spending into so-called 'active' and 'passive' measures. Active measures comprise a wide range of policies aiming at improving the access of the unemployed to the labour market and jobs, job-related skills and the functioning of the labour market. Spending on active measures is, in turn, split into five program areas: public employment services; labour market training; youth measures; subsidised employment; and measures for the disabled.

The second indicator measures public spending on active measures per person unemployed relative to output per member of the labour force. Such normalised measures of public spending on active labour market policies have been used as regressors in cross-country equations attempting to explain OECD unemployment rates by Layard *et al.* (1991), Nickell and Layard (1997), Elmeskov *et al.* (1998) and Scarpetta (1996). They can best be thought of as proxies for the so-called 'replacement rate' paid to participants in active labour market programs, defined as average compensation per participant relative to expected income in work. However, the data are less than ideal for this purpose since they do not relate to that fraction of the unemployed who participate on active measures, but instead relate active spending to the *total* stock of the unemployed in a given year irrespective of whether they participated in a program or not; in addition, the spending data include items other than the compensation or training allowances paid to program participants. Be that as it may, the data in Table 2 reveal a high disparity in spending effort per person unemployed relative to output per member of the labour force across countries in 1996, ranging from 5 per cent or less in the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States to a high of over 30 per cent in Sweden.", "links": [],

The second indicator measures public spending on active measures per person unemployed relative to output per member of the labour force. Such normalised measures of public spending on active labour market policies have been used as regressors in cross-country equations attempting to explain OECD unemployment rates by Layard *et al.* (1991), Nickell and Layard (1997), Elmeskov *et al.* (1998) and Scarpetta (1996). They can best be thought of as proxies for the so-called 'replacement rate' paid to participants in active labour market programs, defined as average compensation per participant relative to expected income in work. However, the data are less than ideal for this purpose since they do not relate to that fraction of the unemployed who participate on active measures, but instead relate active spending to the *total* stock of the unemployed in a given year irrespective of whether they participated in a program or not; in addition, the spending data include items other than the compensation or training allowances paid to program participants. Be that as it may, the data in Table 2 reveal a high disparity in spending effort per person unemployed relative to output per member of the labour force across countries in 1996, ranging from 5 per cent or less in the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States to a high of over 30 per cent in Sweden.", "summary": "Analysis of public spending on active labour market policies across countries, highlighting disparities in spending per unemployed person relative to workforce output."}, "_run_id": "5cb18c76-2729-48bf-ab69-c62b1693965c", "_ts": "2025-10-18T18:19:25.817793+00:00"}

Before turning to the main findings from the recent evaluation literature, I think it is important to stress some caveats concerning the reliability and generality of the conclusions that can be drawn from this literature.\n\n21. First, much of the evaluation literature relates to the United States and Canada where there is a long-standing tradition of evaluating labour market programs. \n\nIndeed, in both countries, there is effectively a mandatory requirement on the public authorities to evaluate their programs. Few European countries have carried out rigorous evaluations until recently.10 This unsatisfactory situation is changing slowly, as tight fiscal constraints make it imperative to get better value for public spending on active labour market policies. As a result, some European countries (I would single out Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom in this regard) and Australia are beginning to see the light as regards undertaking rigorous evaluations of their labour market programs. However, in most other countries, the most common method of 'evaluation' consists of simply monitoring the labour market status and earnings of participants for a brief period following their spell on a program.

Before turning to the main findings from the recent evaluation literature, I think it is important to stress some caveats concerning the reliability and generality of the conclusions that can be drawn from this literature. 21. First, much of the evaluation literature relates to the United States and Canada where there is a long-standing tradition of evaluating labour market programs. Indeed, in both countries, there is effectively a mandatory requirement on the public authorities to evaluate their programs. Few European countries have carried out rigorous evaluations until recently.10 This unsatisfactory situation is changing slowly, as tight fiscal constraints make it imperative to get better value for public spending on active labour market policies. As a result, some European countries (I would single out Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom in this regard) and Australia are beginning to see the light as regards undertaking rigorous evaluations of their labour market programs. However, in most other countries, the most common method of 'evaluation' consists of simply monitoring the labour market status and earnings of participants for a brief period following their spell on a program.

The evidence suggests it may be possible to raise the size of net employment gains associated with private-sector wage subsidies to 20-30 per cent or more via tight targeting of the measures to particular groups among the unemployed and monitoring of employer behaviour in order to curb abuses. However, there is a difficult trade-off for policy-makers here: the evidence also suggests that the more controls are multiplied in order to curb abuse and maximise the net employment gains from wage subsidies, the less willing are firms to participate in such programs and employer take-up drops off sharply, defeating the ultimate goal of the exercise.", "summary": "Evaluations of wage subsidies show limited net employment gains, but targeted measures and monitoring could improve outcomes while balancing employer participation."}, "_run_id": "5cb18c76-2729-48bf-ab69-c62b1693965c", "_ts": "2025-10-18T18:23:07.625878+00:00"}

Recent OECD research also suggests that it is vital to focus on the interactions between active and passive labour market policies if one seeks to enhance the effectiveness of active labour market policies.

Why is this an important topic? Unemployment and related welfare benefits provide income support to the unemployed while they are searching for jobs. It is well known that such benefits can have significant effects on work incentives for the unemployed and on the wage-setting behaviour of workers and employers.
