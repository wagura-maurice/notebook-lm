First, economies are always subject to structural change of various sorts, yet unemployment rates vary a lot across countries and over time, so does it make sense to attribute unemployment to structural causes? Second, even if it is true that in some sense unemployment is structural, is not the adjustment to shifts in demand and technology something which prices and markers are supposed to be for? mat are the causes of market failure in this context, and how far can they justify government intervention! In Section 1 of the paper 1 argue, primarily on the basis of evidence from the United States, that structural changes confronting the industrialised economies are indeed more substantial than in earlier decades and that the outcome of market forces in these circumstances has been a marked increase in income inequality. In most European countries, including Sweden, the political commitment to social insurance is likely to rule out American levels of inequality, and hence will blunt the capacity of market forces to achieve the required structural change. The problem confronting policy-makers in Sweden and elsewhere in Europe is how to achieve labour mobility without removing social protection from those whose jobs are lost in the process of change. Section 2 of the paper offers a brief discussion of the relative merits in principle of active as against passive labour market policies in the context of the dual objectives of encouraging labour mobility and maintaining social protection. The main conclusion of the section is that active policies can maintain people's incomes without creating a disincentive to mobility, whereas cash benefits will discourage mobility. With these considerations in mind, Sections 3 and 4 review the evidence from OECD countries on the effectiveness of active labour market policies.","summary":"The text discusses structural unemployment causes, market failures, and the role of active labour market policies in balancing labour mobility and social protection."},"_run_id":"2eee0a8e-9be0-430f-b467-1bf09dd647f3","_ts":"2025-10-15T10:47:42.973635+00:00"},

The second, which is I think less familiar, was that active labour market policies, by acting as a self-selection mechanism, may reduce an element of the inefficiency associated with the payment of unemployment benefit. This second reason is examined in more detail in this section.\n\nIn a society committed to social protection, one economic rationale for active labour market policies is at root the same as that for the payment of unemployment benefit - namely to protect household incomes from being excessively vulnerable to fluctuations in the labour market. In the absence of private insurance provision, there is a role for government to act to support the living standards of those whose employment opportunities have collapsed. \n\nThis insurance can operate through cash benefits; but it can also take the form of government provision of temporary jobs, paying a wage, or training placements in conjunction with a cash allowance.\n\nThe balance between active policies and cash benefits would in principle be determined as the least cost means of achieving the social protection objective. Cash benefits have low administrative costs and may involve less government interference in the lives of individuals, but blunt the incentive to seek work or to acquire new skills, and may be subject to abuse by the fraudulent or idle. Active policies entail higher administrative costs, but may avoid the abuses to which cash benefits are susceptible and can assist rather than discourage job search and skill acquisition.\n\nIn principle, active policies can be regarded as one way of circurnventing the moral hazard problem of unemployment benefit. The social protection role of benefits requires they be paid to people who (a) are unable to find work, and (b) have no other source of income. One may attempt to enforce these criteria by vigilant administrdtion of the benefit system, but with neither the resources nor the methods of a police state, it may be hard to prevent abuse.

The second, which is I think less familiar, was that active labour market policies, by acting as a self-selection mechanism, may reduce an element of the inefficiency associated with the payment of unemployment benefit. This second reason is examined in more detail in this section. In a society committed to social protection, one economic rationale for active labour market policies is at root the same as that for the payment of unemployment benefit - namely to protect household incomes from being excessively vulnerable to fluctuations in the labour market. In the absence of private insurance provision, there is a role for government to act to support the living standards of those whose employment opportunities have collapsed. This insurance can operate through cash benefits; but it can also take the form of government provision of temporary jobs, paying a wage, or training placements in conjunction with a cash allowance. The balance between active policies and cash benefits would in principle be determined as the least cost means of achieving the social protection objective. Cash benefits have low administrative costs and may involve less government interference in the lives of individuals, but blunt the incentive to seek work or to acquire new skills, and may be subject to abuse by the fraudulent or idle. Active policies entail higher administrative costs, but may avoid the abuses to which cash benefits are susceptible and can assist rather than discourage job search and skill acquisition. In principle, active policies can be regarded as one way of circurnventing the moral hazard problem of unemployment benefit. The social protection role of benefits requires they be paid to people who (a) are unable to find work, and (b) have no other source of income. One may attempt to enforce these criteria by vigilant administrdtion of the benefit system, but with neither the resources nor the methods of a police state, it may be hard to prevent abuse.

Thus only training schemes targeted at these groups have economic returns. Another is that there are increasing returns to training, and only schemes with substantial inputs, which in practice means targeted schemes, actually deliver. This might be the case for example where unemployed people are unfamiliar with the type of skills being taught, or for people unaccustomed to skill acquisition through formal techniques. Without being excessively despondent about the potential value of training schemes to those who go on them, it seems reasonable to think that amongst the unemployed those with adequate formal education who have followed non-manual careers can probably find another job, or acquire new skills, without the need for assistance. On the other hand, those with a poor educational record and with work experience in unskilled jobs may have considerable difficulties in absorbing new skills. Arguably, such groups may require some further formal education before they can make a success of a training programme. The overall conclusion is that training schemes need to be targeted on specific groups and supported by adequate resources. A corollary is that training of this quality cannot be made generally available to all unemployed people. Thus effective training schemes cannot be a large part of a labour market policy which seeks to place every unemployed person on a scheme or in temporary work.", "summary": "Training schemes are effective only when targeted at specific groups with adequate resources, and cannot universally benefit all unemployed individuals."}, "_run_id": "2eee0a8e-9be0-430f-b467-1bf09dd647f3", "_ts": "2025-10-15T10:51:30.951308+00:00"},

Cosmetic effects** While these studies make some attempt to counter the risk of spurious correlation, there remains the important question whether the schemes have a genuine effect or simply a cosmetic function of reclassifying unemployed people as scheme participants. Calmfors (1993, 1994) has reworked these analyses replacing open unemployment by the sum of open unemployment and the number participating in schemes, both as the dependent variable and in calculating expenditures in active policies per client. His findings are that the reduction in open unemployment is of the same order of magnitude as the number participating in the schemes. In interpreting this result, it is important to start from the appropriate theoretical framework. The equilibrium unemployment rate in the medium term is the NAIRU - i.e., the unemployment rate consistent with an absence of inflationary wage pressure.
